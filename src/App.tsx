// Hello and welcome!
// My name is Pavel, and Iâ€™m the creator of this small application.
// I built it to help people discover new books to read â€” stories that might inspire, comfort, or surprise you.

// Right now, the app is only available in English to reach a broader audience,
// but I hope to expand it over time. Iâ€™ll keep improving the content, adding new features, and making this a cozy, reader-friendly space.

// If you have any thoughts or feedback, feel free to reach out â€” Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
// And if you enjoy the idea behind this project, your support would mean a lot. Letâ€™s grow it together.

// Thanks for being here. ðŸŒ¿
