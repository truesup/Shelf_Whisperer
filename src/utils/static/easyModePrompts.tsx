  "I want to escape to a dreamy world where reality blurs into fantasy. Something poetic and otherworldly would be perfect. I'd love lyrical prose that feels like a lullaby and a story that unfolds like a dream. Surprise and softness — that's the mood.",

  'Looking for a whimsical story set on a distant planet. Ideally, something with quirky characters, hidden truths, and strange customs. It should feel imaginative yet grounded in emotion. I want to feel like I’ve been somewhere no one else has been.',

  'I’m in the mood for a slow-burning romance with historical flair. Maybe 19th-century London or Paris, with handwritten letters, forbidden meetings, and the weight of society. I want subtle tension, soft longing, and the ache of missed chances. Something quiet but intense.',

  'Give me a cozy mystery where everyone has a secret. Set it in a charming village full of gossip and hidden motives. Include a cat, a nosy amateur sleuth, and endless cups of tea. Nothing too dark — just clever, comforting, and a little twisty.',

  'I want something dark and academic. Think candlelit libraries, Latin inscriptions, and a tight-knit group hiding something terrible. The tone should be gothic and cerebral, with slow, creeping dread. Bonus points for morally gray characters.',

  'How about a coming-of-age story with magical realism? I’d love something where small, beautiful miracles happen in everyday life. Let the world feel warm, nostalgic, and tinged with wonder. A story that quietly shifts your perspective.',

  'Surprise me with a satirical fantasy. Dragons tangled in red tape, knights filling out quest paperwork, and a kingdom built on absurd logic. I want something smart, funny, and weird. Think Terry Pratchett meets The Office.',

  "I'd love an epic adventure with found family, ancient prophecies, and long journeys across vast lands. The tone should be hopeful but bittersweet, full of loyalty and sacrifice. Let the stakes be high, but the heart even higher. Make me believe in courage again.",

  'Send me into a surreal, dreamy novel where nothing is quite what it seems. Reality should be fluid, timelines blurred, and logic only optional. I want unreliable narrators, metaphor-rich narration, and scenes that feel like they’re painted in watercolor. Haunting, but gentle.',

  'Looking for a story that blends melancholy and beauty. A tale where joy and sorrow coexist, and every sentence carries emotional weight. I want something that stays with me, quietly echoing long after the book ends. Ideally with a poetic or introspective narrator.',

  'Give me a short, powerful book that hits like a thunderclap. Minimalist writing, but heavy on emotion and meaning. I want to feel wrecked in under 200 pages. Something I’ll reread in silence and recommend in whispers.',

  "Make me laugh and think — something sharp, absurd, and clever. I love flawed characters, meta-humor, and situations spiraling into chaos. Let it be witty and self-aware without being cynical. A comedy that knows it's tragic underneath.",
